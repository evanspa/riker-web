I followed these instructions to create a self-signed certificate that Chrome
would trust.

Just run the 2 scripts.  When prompted for common name, use "dev.rikerapp.com"

When done, open the Keychain app and import the ssl/server.crt file.  Once
imported, double click the certificate and choose "Always Trust".
